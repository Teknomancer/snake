To build snake run the following commands:

cd Build/
cmake ..
make

You should now see the binary built and ready to run under "bin/snake".

This is because you can convenient delete the entire "Build" directory to get a clean build if necessary.
'make clean' works to clear out object files but won't clean up CMake generated files.
